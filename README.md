Development Status
==================
This software is currently beta quality and is not feature complete.

There are currently two options on the main menu: 

"Find Me" locates your position and gives you a list of nearby stops. Selecting
one of those stops then gives you a list of the next bus arrivals at that stop
in real time. Pressing select from any item in the arrival list will refresh the
list.

"Favorites" is a simple bookmaking feature. This menu option displays any stops
that you have added to your favorites. To add a stop to favorites simply
long-press the slect key when the stop is hilighted. This list of stops
functions the same as in the "Find Me" feature.

To Do
-----
* Sort Stops by distance from user.
* Add option to auto-refresh stop times.
* Add funcion to track a bus and vibrate when it is due at stop.
